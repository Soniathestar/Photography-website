                Photography is a gentle yet powerful form of magic that allows us to pause time and hold on to moments that would otherwise slip away.Through the lens, fleeting seconds are transformed into lasting memories, preserving emotions, stories and beauty exactly as they were felt in that moment. It teaches us to slow down and truly observe the world, to notice the play of light, the quiet expressions, and the hidden details often missed in everyday life.Photography has the ability to turn ordinary scenes into extraordinary stories, giving meaning to even the simplest moments. Long after time has moved on, a photograph remains, speaking without words. Reminding us of where we have been and how deply beautiful life can be when we take the time to see it. Now lets take a trip down memory lane for some of my favourite photographs

                I took this photo during our Maldives holiday last year. Each picture has a story behind it and this photograph to me is a symbol that at one point of life despite all the storms there will be calm eventually!
